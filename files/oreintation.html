<h3>Orientation	Day</h3>
<p>This	visiting day is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an
  opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet the	teachers and	classmates. This visit is
  one	hour.	It	will	allow	time for	the	child	to	enjoy	free play and	also gives	parent(s)
  a	brief	overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.</p>
<p>The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,
  see	orientation	schedule).	The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday
  or	Thursday.	This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a
  small	group	before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday</p>
