      <h1><b>Assessment and	Parent-Teacher	Conferences</b></h1>
        <p>Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,
          conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers
          keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their
          development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	childrenâ€™s
          writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities
          in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	</p>
        <p>The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
          informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a
          more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any
          time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.</p>
